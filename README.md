## Motivation
This project was originally completed using [Ruby](https://github.com/marcusventin/airport_challenge). I have repeated in order to gain experience using Python.  

The project enables a user to simulate basic airport / airplane interactions. It is intended to satisfy the following user stories:

> As an air traffic controller,  
> So I can get passengers to a destination,  
> I want to instruct a plane to land at an airport.

> As an air traffic controller,  
> So I can get passengers on the way to their destination,  
> I want to instruct a plane to take off from an airport and confirm that it is no longer in the airport.

> As an air traffic controller,  
> To ensure safety,  
> I want to prevent landing when the airport is full.

> As the system designer,  
> So that the software can be used for many different airports,  
> I would like a default airport capacity that can be overridden as appropriate.

> As an air traffic controller,  
> To ensure safety,  
> I want to prevent takeoff when weather is stormy.
